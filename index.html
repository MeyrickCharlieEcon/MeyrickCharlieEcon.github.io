    <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website. I currently run the Economics Observatory website and am manager of the Bristol hub. Having studied economics and mathematics at university, as well as completing a master's degree in international development, I am interested in improving the communication and accessibility of economic research. I have articles written for Bristol Festival of Economics and work as a copyeditor for the Centre for Economic Policy Research and VoxEU.</p>

        <p>Here is an example chart taken from Richard Davies' Rapid Charts page. This particular chart pulls data live from the GOV.UK website via API.</p>
        
        <!--Example embed-->
