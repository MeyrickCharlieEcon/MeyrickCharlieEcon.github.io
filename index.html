    <h1>Charlie Meyrick: Data Visualisation Diary</h1>

    <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website. I currently run the Economics Observatory website and am manager of the Bristol hub. Having studied economics and mathematics at university, as well as completing a master's degree in international development, I am interested in improving the communication and accessibility of economic research. I have articles written for Bristol Festival of Economics and work as a copyeditor for the Centre for Economic Policy Research and VoxEU.</p>

    <p>The main purpose of this site is to document my Data Visualisation work – like a diary. This will be useful for me but may also help you – the user – learn how I work.</p>


    <h3>Questions and charts</h3>

    <body>

        <p>Here is an example chart taken from Richard Davies' Rapid Charts page. This particular chart pulls data live from the GOV.UK website via API.</p>
        
        
          <div class="chart">
            <div id="firstChart">
                <script src="chartCovid1.js"></script>
              </script>
            </div>
          </div>
        
          <p>Here is another chart, this time using static data stored as a CSV on GitHub.</p>
        
          <div class="chart">
            <div id="secondChart">
                <script src="chartLine1.js"></script>
              </script>
            </div>
          </div>
        
          <h3>Some of my own work</h3>

          <p>Here is a chart I made for the new Rapid Charts Environment page.</p>

          <div class="chart">
            <div id="thirdChart">
                <script src="greenChart1.js"></script>
              </script>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>We have been experimenting with different embed methods. The chart below (on land use for palm oil in SE Asia) is embedded into the page as a .JSON file, rather than as a .JS file. Going forward, this is probably what I will use. I need to work out why it is off centre...</p>

          <div class=chart id="fourthChart">

            <script>
              var greenChart2 = "greenChart2.json";
              vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', greenChart2);


            </script>


          </div>

          <p>Here is a live chart linked to the UK Gov API. This was built during a demo Data Science class in July. It should auto update. A note: at the point of writing, Covid cases in Brsitol are concerning...</p>

          <div class=chart id="fifthChart">
            <script>
              var covidAPI1 = "covidChartAPI.json";
              vegaEmbed('#fifthChart', covidAPI1);


            </script>


          </div>


          <p>And UK capital cities...</p>

          <div class=chart id="sixthChart">
            <script>
              var covidAPI2 = "covidChartAPI2.json";
              vegaEmbed('#sixthChart', covidAPI2);


            </script>


          </div>

          <p>I am currently working on interactive area charts as I think these work well with the tooltip feature. Here is an example that I hope to use on the Rapid Charts environment page.</p>

          <div class=chart id="seventhChart">
            <script>
              var greenChart4 = "greenChart4.json";
              vegaEmbed('#seventhChart', greenChart4);


            </script>



          </div>

          <p>For the Radid Charts Crypto page, I recently developed this auto-updating bar chart for stable coins. The chart measures the market cap for each coin and plots the bars accordingly. The data is accessed via the Nomics API.</p>

          <div class=chart id="eighthChart">
            <script>
              var cryptoChart1 = "chartCryptoMktCapStable.json";
              vegaEmbed('#eighthChart', cryptoChart1);

            </script>

          </div>



    
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>This is where I will store my data sources.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>This is where I will publish my Methodology.</p>
